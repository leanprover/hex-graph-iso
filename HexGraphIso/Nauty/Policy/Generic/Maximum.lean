Incumbent bounds for searches with nonlocal returns. The incumbent is
optional until the first leaf and may be a ghost value while executable
code storage is being overwritten. None of these definitions reads the
policy state.

A return below the receiving level transports coverage of a frozen
ancestor child. At that ancestor, the coverage becomes a lower bound;
together with the accumulated upper bound it yields the exact maximum.
