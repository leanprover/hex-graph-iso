The cheapautom triple analogues (SPEC § Verified search refinement,
the code-1 arm of the store-validity obligation).

The first guard branch (`defect ≤ nontrivial + 1`) forces every cell
of the partition to be a singleton, a pair, or one triple, and any two
size-three cells to coincide (the sharpened form of
`hOdd_of_defect_le`'s counting argument). On that shape this file
proves the triple analogues of the pair flip theory:

* `triple_const`: the triple's members have identical bits at every
  member of any other cell of size at most two -- the count into a
  singleton is the adjacency bit, and the count into a pair is twice
  it by `pair_odd_eq`'s both-or-neither;
* `triple_internal`: the induced graph on the triple is empty or
  complete -- the off-diagonal bits are all equal, by the three row-sum
  equalities of equitability (a one-regular graph on three vertices
  is impossible);
* `triple_flip_rows`: the transposition of any two triple members,
  fixing every other vertex, preserves the adjacency rows. Unlike the
  pair flip no matching closure is needed: every other cell is small,
  so the triple's relations to it are constant across the triple.

This file also proves the counting pigeonhole (`labInj_surj`: an
injective bounded labelling on `n` positions is surjective, the
surjectivity hypothesis the flip theorems consume), the transposition's
self-equivalence (`cellsPerm_self_tripleSwap`/`stPerm_self_tripleSwap`:
the mapped labelling is cell-contents equivalent to the original), the
generalized single-deviation theorem (`deviation_leafRows_self`: ANY
row-preserving self-symmetry of a node carrying one child's
individualized vertex to another's mirrors discrete descents with
equal leaf rows -- the uniform door both pair and triple deviations
enter), and its packaged triple instance (`triple_deviation_leafRows`,
which constructs the concrete transposition and discharges every
hypothesis from `IterOk` + equitability + the first-branch shape).
The pair-matching closure `PairReach` and its position toolkit
(start-determinacy, start-never-second, closure members are pairs,
distinct pairs disjoint) close the file.

Remaining on top of this file, in dependency order. (1) The
pair-closure involution: define the swap of every `PairReach`-closure
pair via `Classical.choose` on "some closure pair has this vertex as
its first/second member" -- the position toolkit makes the witness
unique (start-determinacy + `pair_start_ne_second` give the two
existentials' exclusivity, `pair_cells_disj` gives distinctness of
partners) -- then discharge the S-closure hypotheses of `flip_rows` and a
`cellsPerm_self_pairFlip` (mirror of the triple one: closure pairs
swap by `List.Perm.swap`, other cells are fixed because a member of a
closure pair would place its position inside that pair's window), and
package `pair_deviation_leafRows` through `deviation_leafRows_self`
exactly as the triple instance. (2) The node invariant for the
all-leaves induction: `IterOk` + `Equitable` + the first-branch shape
(every cell size ≤ 3, one triple -- descends because `refine_frozen`
keeps closed positions closed, so every child cell sits inside a
parent cell and child triples are parent triples positionally) +
`bcount` accuracy (`bcount_breakout_eq` + `refine_bcount`), with
equitability descending by `equitable_breakout`. (3) The all-leaves
induction: two descents with the same target-position path and
discrete ends have equal leaf rows -- induction on the path; equal
offsets recurse, distinct offsets glue a deviation (pair or triple by
the target's size) and recurse below the second child on the
transported path. (4) The `noncheaplevel` event lemma and the arm-2
assembly in `StoreValid.lean`. (5) The exotic defect-four
configurations outside the first branch, per the probe.

/-! # The triple flip theorem

The transposition of any two triple members, fixing every other
vertex, preserves the adjacency rows. Unlike the pair flip no matching
closure is needed: under the first-branch shape every other cell has
size at most two, so the triple's relations to it are constant across
the triple (`triple_const`), and the internal bits are off-diagonally
constant (`triple_internal`). -/

/-! # The pair-matching closure

The pair deviation needs the involution swapping every pair in the
`PairMatch`-reachability closure of the target pair. This section
defines the closure and proves the position facts its construction
consumes: a cell is determined by its start, a pair start is never
another pair's second position, and every closure member is a pair
cell. -/
