/-!
The automorphism-pruning certificate producer. Everything here is
untrusted: candidates are validated by `validateKey?` (the trusted
`checkKey` replay), and every automorphism prune is self-checked with
the replay's cell-transport predicate (`childCellsOk`) before use, so
a producer bug can only cost performance, never soundness. The honest code-prune producer
`certifyNode` stays in `Cert` untouched; the completeness theorems and
the exhaustive fallback (`Complete`) are stated about it and carry
totality.

Automorphisms are harvested nauty-style from pairs of aligned leaves:
`γ[ref[i]] = lab[i]` (the `workperm` shape) against the pass's first
leaf and the current best-achieving leaf, kept only when the checker's
`checkAutom` accepts. A generator discovered at a divergence node
respects that node's ordered partition and every coarser ancestor
partition, so a single global store plus a per-node cell-respect
filter (`respectsMasks`) makes deep discoveries reusable higher up. The
per-node orbit walk (`witness?`) composes filtered generators by
breadth-first search inside the target cell; this under-approximates
the true partition stabilizer (products of individually non-respecting
generators may respect the partition) and is a heuristic, not a group
computation.

Skipping invariant: a child offset is pruned only against a strictly
earlier offset, so every pruned subtree's key equals the key of an
earlier offset that was either explored or pruned against a yet
earlier one; the chain strictly decreases and terminates at an
explored representative already folded into the running maximum.
