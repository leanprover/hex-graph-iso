/-!
Per-node facts about the search state: the incumbent read off the
state, the generator a code-one leaf records, the positions a call
leaves fixed, and the root.

`nodeKey` is a node's subtree key under its path codes. `stInc` reads
the incumbent from `SearchSt` and `stInc_eq_ghost` identifies it with
the ghost incumbent `ghostInc` that the induction carries.
`firstScatter_get` reads off the generator `processnode` builds as
`workperm[firstlab[i]] := lab[i]`, so the permutation maps `firstlab`
to `lab` pointwise by construction. The `breakout` lemmas say a
singleton cell away from the target cell survives both refinement and
individualization. `rootSt` and `rootOut` are the initial state and the
run's output, and `stInc_final` and `nodeKey_root` read the incumbent
and the subtree key there.

/-! # The incumbent, read off the state

The incumbent has to be an `Option`, because before the first leaf is
installed there is no incumbent and the state's degenerate contents do
not stand in for one. That is not a stylistic choice: at the root
`canonlevel` is `0`, so the code list is empty and `incKey` would read
`⟨[codeSentinel], _⟩`. Every real refinement code is strictly below
`codeSentinel` (`refine_longcode_lt`), so `listCmp` compares
`codeSentinel` against a real first code and answers `.gt`. The
degenerate reading therefore *outranks every reachable leaf key*, and
`keyMax` keeps it. An absorption equation stated with it would assert
that the final incumbent is the degenerate one, which is false as soon
as the search installs anything.

`CanonSpec` is stated with an option for exactly this reason:
`incMax : Option (Key n) → Key n → Key n`, with `none` as the bottom.
The semantic induction threads that option explicitly. The option can
be read back from the imperative state only outside the temporary
upward-comparison window, where `canoncode` contains path codes rather
than the installed incumbent's codes. -/

/-! # The scatter a code-one admission records

`processnode` builds its generator by `workperm[firstlab[i]] := lab[i]`
over `i < n`, so the permutation maps `firstlab` to `lab` pointwise.
`firstScatter_get` reads that fold back one entry at a time, on the two
`foldl` lemmas below.

(`foldl_scatter_getElem`) and consumes exactly this shape in

/-! # The position facts: the step

`payloadAbsorbs_of_positions` takes the two position facts as
hypotheses because they are the descent's bookkeeping. Their base case
is local and is proved here: individualizing offset `o` puts that
offset's vertex at the target position.

The transport of this from the child down to the leaf rests on the
target position being a *singleton cell* from the individualization
onwards. Both steps of that transport are proved below, over one
operation each: `refine` fixes a singleton cell's position, and a
`breakout` elsewhere misses it, because two maximal runs are equal or
disjoint. The run-level statement that composes them is not proved
here, because the descent is the mutual recursion itself. See the note
after `breakout_misses_singleton`. -/

/-! The position facts also need a run-level frame: one call of a
quartet function preserves `lab[q]` at every position that is a
singleton cell on entry. Its proof is an induction over the same
mutual recursion as the absorption equation, discharging `refine` by
`refine_fixes_singleton`, each deeper `breakout` by
`singleton_outside_cell` and `breakout_misses_singleton`, and the
persistence of the singleton itself by `refine_frozen` on both `ptn[q]`
and `ptn[q - 1]`, whose values a deeper `set!` at a different position
does not touch. It is stated as part of that induction rather than
before it because a node's effect on `lab` is only defined through the
recursion. -/

/-! # The root assembly

The root call of `firstPathNode` starts from a state with
`canonlevel = 0`, so its incoming incumbent is `none` and `incMax`
discards it. What comes out is therefore the node key of the root,
which is `canonSpec` by definition, and the state's own incumbent
reading is `tracedKey` by definition.
`certifyCanon?_isSome_of_dominated` then gives the conclusion.

The root instance of the quartet's absorption equation is a hypothesis
of these theorems, and it is the only thing they assume. -/

/-!
The node steps of the quartet.

A node's own work, either side of its child loop, never touches the
incumbent: it refines, records its refinement code and target cell,
adjusts the cheap-automorphism level, and on the way out may lower
`allsamelevel`. Every one of those writes leaves `canonlevel`,
`canoncode` and `canonlab` alone, which are the three fields `stInc`
reads. The lemmas here say exactly that, one write at a time, so the
induction can move the incumbent across a node's non-loop operations
without unfolding anything.

Only the leaf arm is different, and it is different in the one way that
matters: `firstterminal` installs, which is what makes a completed
node's `stInc` a `some`.
