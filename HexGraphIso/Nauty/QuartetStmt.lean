/-!
The quartet's return type (SPEC § Verified search refinement).

This file states, and does not yet prove, what one call of each of
`firstPathNode`, `firstChildLoop`, `otherNode` and `otherChildLoop`
establishes. It exists to fix the shape of the mutual induction's
conclusion before the induction is written, and in particular to
record how a generator return carries its justification.

The design point. A node that returns below `level - 1` abandoned
part of its subtree, so it cannot claim the full absorption equation.
The leaf and the abandoned suffix are discharged separately.  At a
code-one leaf, the sentinel immediately above the current path proves
that its codes equal the first path's codes, and the checked carrier
proves that their rows agree; `auto_keyMax` therefore absorbs the leaf
itself without a path-geometry invariant.  The remaining abandonment is
absorbed *wholesale at the greatest common ancestor*: `processnode`
returns `gcaFirst`, and the recorded generator carries the first path's
child of that ancestor onto the current one, so `childKey_of_carried`
equates the two child subtree keys and the abandoned one is dominated by
a sibling the search already explored.

The carrier fact is direct. `processnode` builds its generator as
`workperm[firstlab[i]] := lab[i]`, so `γ` maps `firstlab` to `lab`
pointwise by construction; the ancestor's target position is frozen
from that level down, so the two entries at that position are exactly
the two individualized vertices. Store validity is local as well: code
one validates its scatter with `isautom` before admission.

/-! # The incumbent, read off the state

The incumbent has to be an `Option`, because before the first leaf is
installed there is no incumbent and the state's degenerate contents do
not stand in for one. That is not a stylistic choice: at the root
`canonlevel` is `0`, so the code list is empty and `incKey` would read
`⟨[codeSentinel], _⟩`. Every real refinement code is strictly below
`codeSentinel` (`refine_longcode_lt`), so `listCmp` compares
`codeSentinel` against a real first code and answers `.gt`. The
degenerate reading therefore *outranks every reachable leaf key*, and
`keyMax` keeps it. An absorption equation stated with it would assert
that the final incumbent is the degenerate one, which is false as soon
as the search installs anything.

`SearchModel` already carries the fix: `incMax : Option Key → Key →
Key` with `none` as the bottom, which is what `searchNode_eq` folds
with.  The semantic induction threads that option explicitly.  It can
be read back from the imperative state only outside the temporary
upward-comparison window, where `canoncode` contains path codes rather
than the installed incumbent's codes. -/

/-- The payload a generator return carries to its target level.

`γ` is the generator `processnode` recorded, it is a checked
automorphism, and it maps the first path's labelling onto the
current one pointwise. The last clause is the whole content: at any
position frozen at or above the return level, the two labellings hold
the two paths' individualized vertices, so `γ` carries one child of
the return level's node onto another. -/

/-- What one node call establishes.

`full` is the absorption equation, available exactly when the node ran
to completion, and `carried` is the generator payload, available
exactly when it did not. The two are stated as implications on the
returned level rather than as a disjunction so that a caller which
knows which case it is in can use the corresponding clause without a
case split. `installed` records that a completed node leaves an
incumbent, which is what makes the `full` equation's left side a
`some`. -/

The loop folds the children from `tv1` onward into the incumbent.
`explored` names the offsets it got through; on a `none` return that
is all of them, and on a `some` return the loop stopped early and the
payload travels on. -/

/-! # The carrier fact is free

The payload's third clause is not an assumption about the search's
history: it follows from how `processnode` builds its generator. This
is the feasibility check for the whole architecture, so it is proved
here rather than asserted.

`StoreValid` already has this fact as a private lemma
(`foldl_scatter_getElem`) and already consumes exactly this shape in
`scatter_isPerm`'s `hsc` hypothesis. At integration the private
lemma should be exposed and these two re-proofs deleted, rather than
kept in parallel. -/

/-- The gca step, which is where a payload is discharged.

/-- The payload discharges, given the two position facts.

The carrier clause holds at every position, so it holds at the
ancestor's target position `tc`; the two hypotheses say what the two
labellings hold there, namely the two paths' individualized vertices.
`childKey_of_carried` then equates the two children's subtree keys.

The position facts are the induction's to supply: they are the
descent's own bookkeeping, not a property of this node. Everything
else here is the node's well-formedness. -/

/-! # The position facts: the step

`payloadAbsorbs_of_positions` takes the two position facts as
hypotheses because they are the descent's bookkeeping. Their base case
is local and is proved here: individualizing offset `o` puts that
offset's vertex at the target position.

The transport of this from the child down to the leaf rests on the
target position being a *singleton cell* from the individualization
onwards. Both steps of that transport are proved below, over one
operation each: `refine` fixes a singleton cell's position, and a
`breakout` elsewhere misses it, because two maximal runs are equal or
disjoint. What is not proved here is the run-level statement that
chains them, since the descent is the mutual recursion itself; see the
note after `breakout_misses_singleton`. -/

/-! What remains for the position facts is a run-level frame: that one
call of a quartet function preserves `lab[q]` at every position that is
a singleton cell on entry. Its proof is an induction over the same
mutual recursion as the absorption equation, discharging `refine` by
`refine_fixes_singleton`, each deeper `breakout` by
`singleton_outside_cell` and `breakout_misses_singleton`, and the
persistence of the singleton itself by `refine_frozen` on both `ptn[q]`
and `ptn[q - 1]`, whose values a deeper `set!` at a different position
does not touch. It is stated as part of that induction rather than
before it because a node's effect on `lab` is only defined through the
recursion. -/

/-! # From the loop's fold to the node's maximum

`LoopConcl.full` is a left fold of `incMax` over the offsets the loop
actually visited, and `specNode_internal` presents the node's key as a
`keysMax` over *all* of them. Two facts bridge the two, and neither
mentions the search: the fold is the maximum, and offsets dominated by
a survivor can be dropped from a maximum.

The second is what the orbit prune and the two sibling filters are
for. `firstChildLoop` skips a child outright when its orbit
representative is not itself (`Search.lean`, the `orbits` test), so the
fold's list is a sublist of the node's children; `childKey_of_orbPruned`
and `longprune_carried`/`shortprune_carried` say each skipped child's
key repeats one that survived, which is exactly the hypothesis of
`keysMax_eq_of_dominated`. -/

This is the algebra the node step performs, with the search abstracted
away: the loop folded the children it visited into the incoming
incumbent, and the node claims the incumbent absorbed the maximum over
*all* its children. The two agree exactly when every child is dominated
by the maximum over the visited ones, which is what the prune
dischargers establish for the children the loop skipped.

The incoming incumbent is handled uniformly, which is the point of
carrying it as an `Option`: with nothing installed the fold's first
child seeds the maximum, and with an incumbent present it is one more
competitor. -/

/-! # The root assembly

The corrected statement reaches the programme's target. The root call
of `firstPathNode` starts from a state with `canonlevel = 0`, so its
incoming incumbent is `none` and `incMax` discards it; what comes out
is therefore the node key of the root, which is `canonSpec` by
definition, and the state's own incumbent reading is `tracedKey` by
definition. `certifyCanon?_isSome_of_dominated` then closes.

The quartet's root instance is the hypothesis here, and it is the only
thing these theorems assume: the induction that supplies it is the
remaining work. -/
