The equitability fixpoint theorem.

`HexGraphIso.Nauty.Equitable.Basic` defines the predicates and proves
the per-pass postconditions. This file proves the certificate
invariant's preservation across a refinement step and assembles
`refine_equitable`: when `refine` exits with its active set exhausted,
the partition is equitable.
