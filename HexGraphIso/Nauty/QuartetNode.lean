/-!
The node steps of the quartet (SPEC § Verified search refinement).

A node's own work, either side of its child loop, never touches the
incumbent: it refines, records its refinement code and target cell,
adjusts the cheap-automorphism level, and on the way out may lower
`allsamelevel`. Every one of those writes leaves `canonlevel`,
`canoncode` and `canonlab` alone, which are the three fields `stInc`
reads. The lemmas here say exactly that, one write at a time, so the
induction can move the incumbent across a node's non-loop operations
without unfolding anything.

Only the leaf arm is different, and it is different in the one way that
matters: `firstterminal` installs, which is what makes a completed
node's `stInc` a `some`.

Each of these is the incumbent-invariance of one field update the node
body performs. They are stated over an arbitrary state rather than over
the node's intermediate states, so they compose in either order and do
not depend on how the body is decomposed. -/

/-! # The leaf arm installs

`firstterminal` is where a first-path leaf becomes the incumbent. These
record what it leaves behind, which is what makes `NodeConcl.installed`
true on the leaf arm and fixes the `some` the absorption equation
needs. -/

/-! # A boundary case `NodeConcl` does not separate

`NodeConcl` splits on the returned level: `full` fires at
`Int.ofNat level - 1` and `carried` strictly below it. The search does
not respect that split, because a node returns `Int.ofNat level - 1` in
two different ways.

`firstChildLoop` at `level` abandons its sweep exactly when a child
returns below `level` (`Search.lean`, the `rtnlevel < Int.ofNat level`
test), handing back `some rtnlevel`; `firstPathNode` then returns that
value unchanged. Since `Int.ofNat level - 1 < Int.ofNat level`, a child
returning `level - 1` makes the node return `Int.ofNat level - 1` with
its loop cut short, so the children after the abandoned one were never
visited. `NodeConcl.full` nonetheless demands the whole subtree's
absorption there, while `NodeConcl.carried`, whose guard is strict,
supplies nothing. `otherNode` has the same shape twice, once after
`processnode` and once after its loop.

The configuration is reachable, not vacuous. `firstChildLoop` sets
`gcaFirst := level` after its `tv1` child returns, so once the loop at
`level - 1` has taken its first-path child, the state carries
`gcaFirst = level - 1`; a later sibling of that loop runs `otherNode` at
`level`, and a code-one `processnode` anywhere below returns
`gcaFirst`, which is `level - 1`. That value propagates up to the node
at `level`, which returns it through the abandoning branch.

The repair is to let the completed case carry a payload too, so that
`full` at `Int.ofNat level - 1` offers the absorption equation *or* a
`CarrierOut`, and the caller's loop discharges the payload at the
ancestor it names. That matches the architecture the file's design note
describes, where a generator return is absorbed at the greatest common
ancestor rather than at the leaf, and it is what lets the loop at
`level - 1` continue instead of propagating. It is not made here
because the root assembly consumes the equation directly
(`dominated_of_root`), so changing the shape means re-deriving that
assembly and checking the root's own boundary, where the node at level
one returns zero. -/
