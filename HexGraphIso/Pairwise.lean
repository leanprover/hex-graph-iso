A verified individualization-refinement isomorphism decision.

`decideIso?` runs one search over ordered-partition pairs: both graphs
are refined in lockstep by neighbour-count signatures, branches whose
refined partition structures diverge are pruned, and a vertex of the
first nonsingleton cell is individualized against every vertex of the
corresponding cell on the other side. A discrete pair induces one
candidate bijection, checked by the proven `checkIso`.

Both verdicts are sound theorems: `some true` produces a checked
transporter (`decideIso?_isomorphic`), and `some false` refutes every
colour-preserving isomorphism (`decideIso?_not_isomorphic`), because a
compatible isomorphism transports each refinement step (`Compat`
preservation) and is pinned to the induced bijection at a discrete
leaf. `none` is exhaustion of the node budget and decides nothing.

This is the verified engine behind the tactic's negative path: unlike
the reference enumeration it is feasible at practical sizes, and unlike
the nauty-compatible search it carries proofs. Its refinement is chosen
for proof cleanliness, not nauty compatibility; the certificate layer
for the nauty-exact search builds on the same equivariance techniques.
