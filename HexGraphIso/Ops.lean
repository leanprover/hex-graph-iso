Public canonical-form operations: the checked-label transcription of
nauty's search, total because the certificate replay accepts its
answer on every input (`Nauty.searchResult?_isSome`). Every theorem
stated here descends from the Lean-proved `specCanon` equivalence
through that agreement.

`canonicalize` is total. `findIso` composes the two canonical labels
into a forward transporter when the canonical forms agree.

which is how every theorem below reaches it. -/
