Coloured graphs: a finite simple undirected graph together with an ordered
vertex colouring in which every colour is used.

nauty calls a vertex colouring a partition and its colour classes cells.
Colours are ordered: the first cell comes before the second cell in every
canonical labelling, and an isomorphism preserves each colour index. The
executable representation is a colour vector plus a surjectivity proof, so
there is no empty cell and no redundant colour count in the public type.

`DecidableEq (Coloring n k)` compares only `cells`; proof irrelevance
handles `onto`. Equality of `Colored n k` is equality of the graph and the
colour vector, which keeps fixture comparison kernel-reducible.
