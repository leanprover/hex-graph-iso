# hex-graph-iso (coloured graph canonical labelling)

`hex-graph-iso` computes canonical forms and isomorphisms of finite simple
undirected graphs with ordered vertex colours. It depends only on
`hex-graph`. It does not depend on Mathlib or on an external graph program.
The separate [hex-graph-iso-mathlib](../../HexGraphIsoMathlib/SPEC/hex-graph-iso-mathlib.md) library relates
these operations to `SimpleGraph` and provides the Mathlib-facing
`graph_iso` tactic.

The first release has two correctness requirements which must not be
confused:

1. Lean proofs establish that two coloured graphs are isomorphic exactly
   when their canonical forms are equal.
2. Conformance tests and source review establish that the canonical form and
   returned label agree exactly with the pinned stable version of nauty.

The second requirement is not a theorem about nauty. The nauty source is an
external compatibility specification. The first requirement is independent
of nauty and remains a theorem even if a later release deliberately changes
the compatibility target.

The two requirements share one refinement-code coordinate system: the
specification's tree, the certificate checker, and the transcribed search
all seed a child node's refinement code with the parent's recomputed cell
count, exactly as nauty does. The declarative characterization behind
requirement 1 — the canonical key is the maximum leaf key of the unpruned
tree — does not depend on that seeding choice; sharing it makes the
search's recorded codes directly comparable with the checker's.

## Scope

The first release includes:

- finite simple undirected graphs on `Fin n`;
- an ordered, nonempty list of colour cells;
- a total canonical-form operation and the label producing that form;
- a budgeted canonical-form operation;
- a Boolean isomorphism decision and one isomorphism when one exists;
- positive and negative certificate checking;
- the Mathlib-free `graph_iso` tactic for closed executable graphs;
- exact compatibility with the pinned dense nauty configuration below.

The first release does not include directed graphs, loops, parallel edges,
sparse-nauty compatibility, Traces, user vertex invariants, or a public
permutation-group implementation. It may discover automorphisms internally
for pruning, but it makes no claim that the discovered automorphisms generate
the complete automorphism group. Complete generators, stabilizer chains, and
explicit isomorphism cosets are later work.

Worst-case canonical labelling remains exponential or factorial. No API in
this library claims a polynomial bound for arbitrary graphs.

## Required `hex-graph` interface

This SPEC can be implemented before a complete SPEC for every graph
algorithm, but it assumes the following `hex-graph` interface. The concrete
names may be placed in the `Hex.Graph` namespace when that library is
specified.

- `Graph n` is a finite simple undirected graph with vertices `Fin n`.
- Adjacency is executable, symmetric, and irreflexive.
- Equality compares the represented edge relation.
- A checked edge-list builder rejects out-of-range endpoints, removes
  duplicate undirected edges, and produces sorted duplicate-free adjacency
  arrays.
- Relabelling by a finite bijection is executable and has an adjacency
  correspondence theorem.

The public graph stays in that representation. `hex-graph-iso` owns a private
dense bit matrix used by refinement and canonical comparison. The conversion
to the bit matrix is proved to preserve adjacency. The private representation
does not introduce a storage typeclass into `hex-graph`.

## Ordered colours

nauty calls a vertex colouring a partition and its colour classes cells. Its
colours are ordered. The first cell comes before the second cell in every
canonical labelling. An isomorphism preserves each colour index and may not
permute the cells.

The executable representation is a vector plus a proof that every colour is
used:

```lean
structure Coloring (n k : Nat) where
  cells : Vector (Fin k) n
  onto : Function.Surjective cells.get

structure Colored (n k : Nat) where
  graph : Graph n
  coloring : Coloring n k
```

These field names and this representation are the public contract.
`DecidableEq (Coloring n k)` compares only `cells`. Proof irrelevance handles
`onto`. Equality of `Colored n k` is equality of the graph and the colour
vector. This avoids equality on function fields and makes fixture comparison
kernel-reducible.

Surjectivity matches nauty's partition representation, which has no empty
cell. It also removes redundant colour counts from the public type.

- The empty graph is represented with `n = 0` and `k = 0`.
- A nonempty uncoloured graph uses `k = 1` and the constant zero vector,
  built by `Graph.singleColor` (see
  [The uncoloured surface](#the-uncoloured-surface)).
- No value of `Colored n 0` exists when `n > 0`.

The output colouring of a canonical form has contiguous cells in their
original order. If the cell sizes are `s₀, ..., sₖ₋₁`, the first `s₀` new
vertices have colour zero, the next `s₁` have colour one, and so on.

## Permutations, labels, and relabelling

The executable permutation data is an array of all vertices with a no-
duplicates proof. The library provides checked construction, identity,
inverse, composition, indexing, and extensional equality. Two wrappers make
the direction visible at use sites:

- `Perm n` maps an old vertex to its image. An isomorphism from `G` to `H`
  uses this direction.
- `Label n` stores the old vertex at each new position. This is nauty's
  `canonlab` convention.

For `l : Label n`, relabelling is defined by

```text
(relabel G l).adj i j     = G.adj l[i] l[j]
(relabel G l).coloring[i] = G.coloring[l[i]].
```

An isomorphism predicate has the mathematical direction:

```lean
def IsIso (G H : Colored n k) (p : Perm n) : Prop :=
  (forall i, H.coloring[p i] = G.coloring[i]) ∧
  (forall i j, H.graph.adj (p i) (p j) = G.graph.adj i j)

def Isomorphic (G H : Colored n k) : Prop :=
  Exists fun p => IsIso G H p
```

The actual definition should use bounded quantifiers and executable Boolean
checkers in addition to these propositional views. `checkIso` is sound and
complete for `IsIso`.

If canonical labels for `G` and `H` are `lG` and `lH`, the forward
transporter from `G` to `H` is `lH` composed with the inverse of `lG`, with
the conversions between label and forward-permutation conventions made
explicit in the implementation.

## Public operations

The canonical result keeps its form and label together:

```lean
structure CanonResult (n k : Nat) where
  form : Colored n k
  label : Label n
```

The public surface is one tier. The names in `Hex.GraphIso` are the
checked-label transcription of the pinned nauty search, run directly
with no certificate replay on the answer path, and they carry the
whole theorem surface.

```lean
def canonicalize (G : Colored n k) : CanonResult n k
def canon (G : Colored n k) : Colored n k := (canonicalize G).form
def label (G : Colored n k) : Label n := (canonicalize G).label
def findIso (G H : Colored n k) : Option (Perm n)
def isIso (G H : Colored n k) : Bool
```

`canonicalize` is total: termination follows from the strictly
increasing number of singleton cells along each individualization
path and finite branching, and worst-case running time can still be
factorial. The theorems reach it through the certificate checker
without running it: the proven replay accepts the transcription's own
answer on every input (`Nauty.certifyCanon?_isSome`, the theorem of
[Verified search refinement](#verified-search-refinement)), the
transcription is `Option`-valued only in its executable spelling and
answers on every input (`Nauty.canonicalize?_isSome`), and
`canonicalize` is that answer with no fallback match
(`canonicalize_eq_certifyCanon`). The declarative canonical form
`Nauty.specCanon` is the anchor: `canon_eq_specCanon` identifies the
public form with it, and every statement below is the corresponding
`specCanon` theorem transported along that identity.

The required API theorems:

```lean
theorem relabel_label (G : Colored n k) :
    relabel G (label G) = canon G

theorem canon_iso (G : Colored n k) :
    Isomorphic G (canon G)

theorem canon_invariant {G H : Colored n k} :
    Isomorphic G H -> canon G = canon H

theorem iso_iff_canon_eq (G H : Colored n k) :
    Isomorphic G H <-> canon G = canon H

theorem findIso_sound (G H : Colored n k) (p : Perm n) :
    findIso G H = some p -> IsIso G H p

theorem findIso_isSome_iff (G H : Colored n k) :
    (findIso G H).isSome = true <-> Isomorphic G H

theorem isIso_eq_true_iff (G H : Colored n k) :
    isIso G H = true <-> Isomorphic G H

theorem isIso_eq_false_iff (G H : Colored n k) :
    isIso G H = false <-> Not (Isomorphic G H)

theorem isomorphic_of_isIso (G H : Colored n k) :
    isIso G H = true -> Isomorphic G H
```

The biconditional compares canonical coloured graphs. It does not compare
labels: those arrays refer to different input vertex names and generally
differ for isomorphic inputs.

The resource-bounded surface separates search limits from replay
limits:

```lean
structure SearchLimits where
  maxNodes : Nat := 100000
  maxCertNodes : Nat := 100000

structure ReplayLimits where
  maxCheckerSteps : Nat := 5000000

def findIso? (search : SearchLimits) (G H : Colored n k) :
    Option (Option (Perm n))

def checkIso? (replay : ReplayLimits) (G H : Colored n k)
    (p : Perm n) : Option Bool

def canon? (search : SearchLimits) (replay : ReplayLimits)
    (G : Colored n k) : Option (CanonResult n k)
```

`maxNodes` counts every refined partition visited, including the root.
`maxCertNodes` counts every proof-rule record emitted. Replay work charges one
step for each proof-rule record, vertex or permutation entry inspected, and
dense adjacency word inspected. All counters use checked `Nat` arithmetic.
An implementation may account conservatively — refuse up front by charging an
upper bound on a counter, or charge whole-certificate record counts — provided
accepted work never exceeds the declared budget; exhaustion may therefore be
reported for inputs an exact counter would have admitted.
For `findIso?`, outer `none` means exhaustion, `some none` is a completed
non-isomorphism result, and `some (some p)` is a found transporter. For the
other bounded operations, exhaustion also returns `none`. Exhaustion is not
evidence of non-isomorphism.

The required theorems of the bounded search:

```lean
namespace FindIso

theorem some_sound (search : SearchLimits)
    (G H : Colored n k) (p : Perm n) :
    findIso? search G H = some (some p) -> IsIso G H p

theorem none_sound (search : SearchLimits)
    (G H : Colored n k) :
    findIso? search G H = some none -> Not (Isomorphic G H)

end FindIso
```

## The uncoloured surface

Colours are the general input, but most callers hold a bare `Graph n`.
The library therefore states isomorphism directly on `Graph n` and
mirrors the whole surface there, so an uncoloured caller neither builds
a `Colored n 1` at the call nor unwraps one from the conclusion.

```lean
def Graph.singleColor (G : Graph n) (h : 0 < n) : Colored n 1

def Graph.IsIso (G H : Graph n) (p : Perm n) : Prop :=
  forall i j, H.adj (p i) (p j) = G.adj i j

def Graph.Isomorphic (G H : Graph n) : Prop :=
  Exists fun p => Graph.IsIso G H p
```

`n = 0` forces `k = 0`, so `Graph.singleColor` and every operation
below take `0 < n`. The hypothesis is an auto-parameter discharged by
`decide` or `omega`, so it is invisible at a concrete size. `decide`
comes first because it closes a literal size with a self-contained
term, where `omega` lifts an auxiliary theorem that is named in the
root namespace when the call sits in a command with no enclosing
declaration.

One equivalence carries the whole surface:

```lean
theorem Graph.isIso_singleColor_iff (G H : Graph n) (p : Perm n)
    (h : 0 < n) :
    IsIso (G.singleColor h) (H.singleColor h) p <-> Graph.IsIso G H p

theorem Graph.isomorphic_singleColor_iff (G H : Graph n) (h : 0 < n) :
    Isomorphic (G.singleColor h) (H.singleColor h) <->
      Graph.Isomorphic G H
```

The colour clause of `IsIso` is vacuous at one colour, which is what
makes this an equivalence rather than one implication. Every theorem
of the uncoloured surface is transported along it rather than
reproved, so the uncoloured operations make exactly the promises their
coloured originals make.

```lean
def Graph.canon (G : Graph n) (h : 0 < n) : Graph n
def Graph.label (G : Graph n) (h : 0 < n) : Label n
def Graph.findIso (G H : Graph n) (h : 0 < n) : Option (Perm n)
def Graph.isIso (G H : Graph n) (h : 0 < n) : Bool
```

The canonical form is the underlying graph of the coloured canonical
form, so the two agree by construction. The required uncoloured
theorems mirror the coloured ones:

```lean
theorem Graph.relabel_label (G : Graph n) (h : 0 < n) :
    G.relabel (Graph.label G h).get = Graph.canon G h

theorem Graph.canon_iso (G : Graph n) (h : 0 < n) :
    Graph.Isomorphic G (Graph.canon G h)

theorem Graph.iso_iff_canon_eq (G H : Graph n) (h : 0 < n) :
    Graph.Isomorphic G H <-> Graph.canon G h = Graph.canon H h

theorem Graph.canon_invariant :
    Graph.Isomorphic G H -> Graph.canon G h = Graph.canon H h

theorem Graph.findIso_sound :
    Graph.findIso G H h = some p -> Graph.IsIso G H p

theorem Graph.findIso_isSome_iff (G H : Graph n) (h : 0 < n) :
    (Graph.findIso G H h).isSome = true <-> Graph.Isomorphic G H

theorem Graph.isIso_eq_true_iff (G H : Graph n) (h : 0 < n) :
    Graph.isIso G H h = true <-> Graph.Isomorphic G H

theorem Graph.isIso_eq_false_iff (G H : Graph n) (h : 0 < n) :
    Graph.isIso G H h = false <-> Not (Graph.Isomorphic G H)

theorem Graph.isomorphic_of_isIso :
    Graph.isIso G H h = true -> Graph.Isomorphic G H
```

`Isomorphic.graph` and `IsIso.graph` forget the colours of a coloured
isomorphism at any `k`, and `Colored.ext_graph` recovers a `Colored n 1`
from its graph. The uncoloured equivalence relation carries the usual
`refl`, `symm` and `trans`.

The uncoloured canonical form of a graph is the graph of its coloured
canonical form, so the conformance fixtures, the benchmark corpus and
the nauty compatibility target are stated on the coloured surface only;
nothing about the uncoloured names needs separate pinning.

## Reference canonical form

`Hex.GraphIso.Reference` contains the first implementation. It first constructs
the colour-sorting label, which lists vertices by increasing colour and then
by original vertex. It enumerates all permutations of the label entries within
each contiguous output cell, relabels the graph, and selects the largest
serialized coloured adjacency matrix under an explicitly defined lexicographic
order. The order compares cell sizes first and then upper-triangle adjacency
bits in row-major order.

This definition has its own proofs of the relabelling, isomorphism, and
biconditional theorems (the analogues of `relabel_label`, `canon_iso`,
and `iso_iff_canon_eq`). It is suitable for exhaustive small tests and
for checking later implementations. It is not used as a production
fallback and is not required to return nauty's label or canonical form.

The public `canon` is the checked-label transcription of the nauty
search; its theorems come from the certificate replay, which is proven
to accept the transcription's answer on every input. Development
namespaces (`Reference`, `Nauty`) remain available as the cross-check
and the transcription layer.

## nauty-compatible individualization and refinement

The production search is derived from the pinned nauty source. Its state
contains an ordered partition, the active cells, the individualized vertices,
the refinement code at each level, the first-path and best-so-far data, and
the automorphisms and orbit information justified so far.

The following behavior is fixed before adding pruning:

1. Initial vertices occur in `(colour, original vertex)` order.
2. Equitable refinement uses the same splitter order, count buckets, cell
   order, and refinement-code arithmetic as dense nauty, including seeding
   each level's code with the current cell count.
3. Target-cell selection reproduces `targetcell` and `bestcell` for the
   configured `tc_level`.
4. Candidate vertices are individualized in the same order as nauty.
5. Refinement-code sequences are compared before canonical graphs.
6. `testcanlab` and `updatecan` define leaf comparison and partial-row reuse.
7. Equal canonical graphs use nauty's exact canonical-label tie-breaking.

The unpruned search must already produce the pinned nauty result. Later stages
add the pruning performed by the pinned default configuration:

1. comparison against first-path and best-so-far refinement codes;
2. verified automorphisms from equivalent leaves;
3. orbit pruning justified by those automorphisms;
4. short-prune and the remaining default dense-nauty return rules;
5. packed bitsets, reusable arrays, and iterative traversal where these do not
   alter the observable traversal.

Every pruning lemma states that the selected canonical form and selected
label are unchanged. Preserving only the isomorphism class is insufficient
for exact `canonlab` compatibility. Orbit data may omit true orbit relations,
which only loses pruning. It must never join vertices without a checked
automorphism proving the relation.

The first release keeps `schreier = false`, matching the pinned defaults. A
later complete automorphism-group API may add a permutation-group dependency,
but it must not silently change `canon` or `label`.

## Canonical certificates

The negative tactic cannot prove non-isomorphism by checking a proposed
permutation. It needs evidence that each reported form is canonical. The
certificate design follows Banković, Drecun, and Marić's
[proof system for graph (non)-isomorphism verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14303),
adapted to the exact ordered-colour and nauty-selection rules in this SPEC.

`CanonCert` is plain data. It records enough information to replay:

- the initial ordered partition;
- each deterministic refinement and its code;
- each target-cell choice and individualization;
- every surviving leaf and its label;
- every canonical comparison which discards a leaf or subtree;
- every automorphism used for an orbit or short-prune step;
- the selected form and label.

The checker reconstructs partitions, adjacency counts, codes, permutations,
and comparisons from the original graph. Cached counts and hashes in a
certificate are hints only and are recomputed before use.

```lean
def certify? (limits : SearchLimits) (G : Colored n k) : Option CanonCert

def checkCanon (limits : ReplayLimits) (G : Colored n k)
    (cert : CanonCert) : Option (CanonResult n k)

theorem checkCanon_sound
    (h : checkCanon limits G cert = some result) :
    result.form = canon G ∧ relabel G result.label = result.form

theorem canon?_eq_some
    (h : canon? search replay G = some result) :
    result.form = canon G ∧ relabel G result.label = result.form
```

The producer/checker agreement theorem states that a successful in-Lean
producer result is accepted when its replay limit is at least the work count
reported by the producer. The tactic nevertheless treats compiled producer
output as untrusted and calls `checkCanon` before emitting anything.

For a negative decision, `DiffCert` names the first differing field in the
canonical encodings. `checkDiff` verifies the two encodings agree before that
position and differ there. The proof is exactly the composition of two
`checkCanon_sound` applications, `checkDiff`, and `iso_iff_canon_eq`.

Certificate size and checker work are proportional to the justified search
tree. The SPEC makes no promise that negative certificates are short on every
input.

### Trace-driven production

The producer must not search. The transcribed search already makes
every decision a certificate records (splits, refinement codes,
target cells, discovered automorphisms, prune events) and discards
them, so the certificate pipeline is required to have the
transcription append its decisions to a trace and produce the
certificate by translating that trace, instead of re-running a pruned
search of its own. The trace is untrusted exactly as the producer is:
the checker recomputes everything from the graph, and a wrong trace
can only make validation fail, never accept a wrong answer.

Requirements on the implementation:

- Recording must not alter the transcription's observable traversal
  (the conformance-pinned node counts, forms, and labels).
- Users of `canonicalize` who request no certificate must not pay for
  tracing; the traced walk is a separate entry point or an opt-in of
  the certificate pipeline.
- The certificates emitted remain subject to the same replay, the
  same size accounting, and the same conformance size guards as
  search-produced ones. The bounded producer bounds the traced walk
  under the same node budget.
- Adoption must not regress the certificate pipeline on the
  benchmark instances: the stage profiler and the certificate-size
  guards are the acceptance checks.

The regression requirement is expected to hold by construction, and
an implementation failing it indicates a translation defect rather
than a cost inherent to the design: the translator reads the complete
trace before emitting anything, so the final key, the full harvested
generator set, and the whole tree shape are in hand at every emission
decision, and the translator can emit certificates equivalent to
search-produced ones. (Online emission during the walk lacks exactly
this information and inflates certificates; a trace-driven translator
is offline by construction.) Production cost then drops by the whole
duplicate search, tracing adds a constant per visited node to the
certificate path only, and replay cost is unchanged.

Trace-driven production composes with
[Verified search refinement](#verified-search-refinement): with a
trace-driven producer, layer four of that programme (the
transcription selects the same leaf as the producer) collapses into
layers one and two, since the producer's walk *is* the transcription's.

## Verified search refinement

The pruned production search refines the declarative canonical form:
this is the theorem behind the one-tier public surface, and it is a
release requirement (release condition 4 below is discharged by it).
It is proved. This section records the decomposition and what the
theorem buys.

The statement is totality of the certificate pipeline:

```lean
theorem Nauty.certifyCanon?_isSome (G : Colored n k) :
    (Nauty.certifyCanon? G).isSome
```

where `Nauty.certifyCanon?` is the unbudgeted producer followed by
the single `checkCanon` replay of the transcription's labelling. The
proposition decomposes into one totality lemma and three refinement
layers, each independently useful:

1. **Producer totality.** The unbudgeted producer always returns a
   candidate: with no node budget the two-pass walk cannot exhaust.
   Structural induction over the search tree.
2. **The producer refines the checker.** Every certificate the
   producer emits replays successfully. The second pass evaluates the
   checker's own acceptance conditions against the final key before
   emitting each record, so the obligation is that the producer's
   state invariants justify those evaluations: admitted generators
   are automorphisms, the witness search returns genuine group
   elements, and the orbit and cell-mask bookkeeping is consistent.
3. **The pruned search refines the unpruned tree.** The first pass's
   selected key equals `canonSpecKey`, the maximum over the unpruned
   individualization-refinement tree: automorphism and orbit pruning
   discard only subtrees whose leaves are dominated. This layer
   formalizes the classical soundness arguments (Hartke and
   Radcliffe) and is the largest.
4. **The transcription refines the producer.** The transcribed search
   selects the same leaf as the producer, including the exact
   tie-breaking. Under the required
   [trace-driven production](#trace-driven-production) the producer's
   walk *is* the transcription's, so this layer collapses into layers
   one and two; it survives as a separate obligation only for a
   search-based producer.

The proof as landed relates the executable recursion to the
declarative one directly rather than through a shared parameterized
recursion: the two node statements (`FirstTotal`, `OtherTotal`) are
proved together by induction on the executable recursion fuel, the
root instance identifies the specification key with the traced key
(`canonSpecKey_eq_tracedKey`), and the certificate replay is then
shown to accept. The producer and the checker share their per-node
component checks (child-cell, automorphism and cell-permutation
validation) but remain two recursions related by replay theorems.
The design constraints the layers impose, which any restructuring of
the pipeline must keep:

- Layer two wants one per-node acceptance predicate, evaluated by the
  producer at emission and by the checker at replay, so their
  agreement is congruence on a shared definition rather than a proof
  maintained against two parallel spellings. Emission may evaluate
  only the conjuncts that admission does not already imply (today it
  skips the generator-automorphism conjunct, which holds by closure
  over admitted generators).
- Layer three favours a single tree recursion parameterized by a
  pruning policy, which the declarative form instantiates with the
  empty policy and the production walk with the real one, so that the
  refinement theorem quantifies over policies instead of relating two
  unrelated recursions.
- The replay-monotonicity property inside layer two is what makes
  single-pass certificate emission sound; in a trace-driven
  translator it justifies the collapse of dominated subtrees before
  emission.
- With the declarative form and these proofs carrying the
  correctness story, the `Reference` implementation's cross-check
  role reduces to conformance testing on small cases.

Label-level agreement is available only along this route. The checker
pins a labelling's rows, not the labelling itself, so an exhaustive
fallback that selects some other member of the automorphism coset
could not be identified with the transcription's label; the fallback
has to be proven unreachable, which is exactly the theorem.

The payoff is a total, non-`Option` surface with no fallback arm
anywhere:

```lean
def Nauty.certifyCanon (G : Colored n k) : CanonResult n k :=
  (Nauty.certifyCanon? G).get (Nauty.certifyCanon?_isSome G)

theorem Nauty.canonicalize?_isSome (G : Colored n k) :
    (Nauty.canonicalize? G).isSome

def canonicalize (G : Colored n k) : CanonResult n k :=
  (Nauty.canonicalize? G).get (Nauty.canonicalize?_isSome G)

theorem canonicalize_eq_certifyCanon (G : Colored n k) :
    canonicalize G = Nauty.certifyCanon G
```

Totality transports from the certificate pipeline to the transcription
through `Nauty.canonicalize?_eq_of_certifyCanon`, and the theorem
surface of [Public operations](#public-operations) is the certificate
checker's theorem surface transported along
`canonicalize_eq_certifyCanon`. No certificate is produced or replayed
on the answer path; certificates and the replay checker remain as the
proof layer for the `graph_iso` tactic, whose kernel obligations must
stay certificate-sized.

## The Mathlib-free `graph_iso` tactic

The library registers `graph_iso` for closed goals over executable
`Colored n k` values and over executable `Graph n` values:

```lean
example : Isomorphic G H := by
  graph_iso

example : Not (Isomorphic G H) := by
  graph_iso

example : Graph.Isomorphic G H := by
  graph_iso

example : Not (Graph.Isomorphic G H) := by
  graph_iso

example : Isomorphic G H := by
  graph_iso (maxNodes := 200000) (maxCheckerSteps := 10000000)
```

An uncoloured goal is coloured with the single colour zero and its
conclusion transported back through `Graph.isomorphic_singleColor_iff`,
so both shapes run the same routes below. Both directions of that
equivalence are proof terms, so the uncoloured route adds nothing to
the kernel obligation beyond one decision of `0 < n`.

The configuration syntax is the parenthesized named syntax shown above.
Each of `maxNodes`, `maxCertNodes`, and `maxCheckerSteps` is optional, may
appear in any order, and may appear at most once. Bare `graph_iso` uses all
three defaults.

For a positive goal, compiled `findIso?` search returns a literal forward
permutation under `maxNodes`. The tactic emits that permutation and closes the
goal through replay-bounded `checkIso?` and its soundness theorem. It need not
compute complete canonical certificates. Search or replay exhaustion leaves
the goal unchanged.

For a negative goal, the tactic first tries the root separator. If that
does not distinguish the graphs, the compiled search produces a
canonical-key certificate for each graph and the tactic uses that route
whenever both certificates fit the configured budgets. The kernel
replays the two Boolean certificate checks and their key comparison,
closing the goal through `not_isomorphic_of_checkKeysP` (`checkKeyP`
twice plus `checkDiff`, with no achieving labelling reified). `checkKeyP`
(`HexGraphIso/NodePacked.lean`) is the replay over kernel-priced
state: the labelling, the partition and the adjacency rows are
fixed-width fields packed into one `Nat` each, every step is spelled
with the `Nat` functions the kernel accelerates, and counted loops
run through one `Nat.rec` step per iteration; it is proven equal to
`checkKey`, so the soundness theorems keep mentioning the `Array`
definitions the compiled search runs. The adjacency of each graph is
tied to one packed literal (`packRowsK`), one sequential kernel
evaluation of the graph's definition per side. When certificate
production fails or a certificate exceeds the configured budgets, the
tactic tries the two-code separator and then replays the full-budget
verified individualization-refinement decision
(`decideIso?_not_isomorphic`). That final pairwise route anchors the
exhaustion semantics: `none` never proves non-isomorphism. The two
separator legs (`sepRootLitP`, `sepDiffLitP`) replay the same packed
refinement. No result relies on compiler trust. All routes share an
irreducible kernel cost evaluating the goal's graph definitions
themselves, so family-style definitions with expensive adjacency set a
floor no route can undercut. The certificate obligations replay only
while their whole reduction closure stays exposed to the module-mode
kernel; the regression ladder in
`HexGraphIso/ModuleBoundaryTests.lean` pins that closure (it caught
missing exposure on two refinement helpers and on core's `Array.map`,
worked around per `HexBasic.OfFn` pending the upstream exposure fixes).

The library builds with `precompileModules`, so the compiled search
the tactic runs at elaboration time runs compiled rather than
interpreted whenever the library's shared objects are loaded (a
downstream `lake build`, or `lake lean` on a file; `lake env lean`
interprets). The kernel cost of the negative routes is measured by
`scripts/bench/graphiso_kernel_cost.py`, which reports type-checking
time per certificate record and its exponent in the vertex count over
the cactus corpus; its records live under `reports/bench-results/`
as `hexgraphiso-kernel-*.json`, and every change to the replay is
judged against them.

Malformed data, a failed check, an open term, or any exhausted limit leaves
the goal unchanged and reports which phase and logical limit failed. Search
exhaustion never closes a negative goal. No implementation or test uses
`native_decide`, and no theorem is introduced as an axiom.

## Manual example: the Petersen graph three ways

The first manual chapter, `HexManual/Chapters/HexGraphIso.lean`, includes one
substantial example rather than only small path and cycle demonstrations. It
defines the following Mathlib-free graphs locally from their edge predicates:

- the generalized Petersen presentation `G(5, 2)` on `Fin 10`;
- the Kneser presentation `K(5, 2)`, obtained by listing the two-element
  subsets of `Fin 5` in lexicographic order on `Fin 10` and joining disjoint
  pairs;
- the pentagonal prism on `Fin 10`.

The chapter states the positive and negative claims on bare `Graph 10`
values, through `Graph.Isomorphic`, since neither claim mentions
colours. It checks that the canonical searches compose into an explicit
vertex transporter between the two presentations,
then uses `graph_iso` to prove that the first two presentations are isomorphic.
The text explains how an outer pentagon, inner star, and spokes become disjoint
pairs. It then uses the same tactic to prove that the Petersen graph is not
isomorphic to the pentagonal prism. This negative example is
interesting because both graphs have ten vertices and every vertex has degree
three. Degree refinement alone does not settle it.

The chapter also gives the Petersen graph three ordered two-colourings with
identical cell sizes, which is where the coloured surface enters. Two
colourings mark different edges as colour zero.
`graph_iso` proves them isomorphic and returns a colour-preserving transporter.
The third marks a nonadjacent pair as colour zero. `graph_iso` proves it is not
isomorphic to either edge-marked colouring. This is the manual's compact
illustration that ordered colours constrain isomorphisms and are not merely
refinement hints.

All constructors used by the chapter are ordinary Lean definitions in the
chapter or public graph operations. The example is compiled with the manual,
records explicit logical limits, and does not depend on an external nauty
installation. The Mathlib companion presents the same positive and negative
claims through `SimpleGraph`. Its requirements are stated in
[hex-graph-iso-mathlib.md](../../HexGraphIsoMathlib/SPEC/hex-graph-iso-mathlib.md#manual-example-with-mathlib).

## Manual chapter: the nauty canonical labelling algorithm

`HexManual/Chapters/NautyAlgorithm.lean` is a standalone manual chapter
titled "The `nauty` canonical labelling algorithm". It appears in the
table of contents directly after the `HexGraphIso` chapter, and the
`HexGraphIso` introduction links to it. Its subject is the exact
function this library computes: the canonical form and label returned
by dense nauty 2.9.3 under the pinned configuration of the
[compatibility target](#nauty-compatibility-target).

### Purpose

No published document specifies that function. The chapter opens by
saying so, and by placing the three closest documents:

- McKay's original paper (*Practical graph isomorphism*, 1981) gives
  pseudocode detailed enough to reimplement, but it describes the
  algorithm as of 1981, and later releases changed output-relevant
  details.
- Hartke and Radcliffe (*McKay's canonical graph labeling algorithm*,
  2009) explain the ideas: the search tree, refinement, and why pruning
  is sound. They deliberately omit the code-level choices that decide
  which leaf wins.
- McKay and Piperno (*Practical graph isomorphism, II*, 2014) and the
  user's guide describe a framework parameterized over the refinement
  function, the target-cell rule, and the node invariant. Every
  instantiation yields a canonical form. None of these documents pins
  the one `densenauty` returns.

For exact output the C source is the only specification, and it
interleaves the choices that determine the answer with pruning and
storage reuse that provably do not. The chapter's central observation
is that the two can be separated. The canonical form is characterized
declaratively as the maximal leaf key of the unpruned
individualization-refinement tree, and every pruning rule carries a
Lean proof that it preserves the selected form and label. A complete
specification therefore only has to describe the unpruned tree and the
key order.

The chapter states its epistemic status explicitly, mirroring the two
correctness requirements at the top of this SPEC: agreement between
the chapter's description and the Lean implementation is enforced by
theorems and by the Verso build, while agreement between the Lean
implementation and nauty 2.9.3 is an empirical claim established by
conformance testing, not a theorem.

### Part one: the algorithm in natural language

The first part uses no Lean identifiers and no code blocks. Its
audience is a mathematician or computer scientist who knows basic
graph theory but knows nothing about this algorithm, Lean, or nauty.
Every term is defined before its first use: no vocabulary from the
implementation (splitter, hint, code chain, active cell, dominated)
may appear before the sentence that defines it, and every word keeps
its ordinary meaning, per [SPEC/writing-style.md](../../SPEC/writing-style.md).
The introduction previews the chapter in plain words only. The
quality bar: a careful reader could reimplement the function from
part one alone, and the reimplementation would agree with nauty 2.9.3
on every input. Content, in order:

1. The problem. Finite simple undirected graphs with ordered vertex
   colours, what a canonical form is (a function invariant under
   isomorphism whose output is isomorphic to its input), why
   isomorphism testing reduces to it, and why infinitely many valid
   canonical forms exist. This chapter describes one particular
   choice.
2. Ordered partitions and equitable refinement. Cells in a fixed
   order, the initial ordered partition (colour classes in colour
   order, each listing its vertices by increasing original vertex),
   refinement of a cell by neighbour counts into another cell,
   the equitable fixed point, and the fact that refinement is
   isomorphism-equivariant. One worked example on a small graph
   (roughly five to seven vertices) showing an inequitable partition
   refined to its equitable fixed point, with the intermediate splits
   displayed.
3. The individualization-refinement tree. When the equitable partition
   is not discrete, choose a target cell, branch on each of its
   vertices by splitting the chosen vertex into a singleton, and
   refine again. Leaves are discrete partitions, and a discrete
   partition is a labelling of the graph.
4. The leaf key and the selection rule. Each node records a
   refinement code, an integer digest of the refinement trace. A
   leaf's key is its chain of codes, then a sentinel value, then the
   adjacency rows of the relabelled graph. Keys compare
   lexicographically, and the canonical labelling is the leaf with the
   maximal key. The sentinel exceeds every real code, which is why a
   shallower leaf beats a deeper one with an equal code prefix.
5. The code-level choices. This is the content absent from the
   literature, and each item must be described precisely enough to
   reimplement: the refinement-code accumulator arithmetic (nauty's
   `MASH`), the order in which pending splitter cells are processed,
   the stable redistribution of a split cell by neighbour count, the
   separate single-vertex-splitter split (including the resulting
   fragment order), which fragments of a split cell become pending and
   which one is exempt (with the tie rules, which differ between the
   two splits), exactly when a new singleton fragment becomes the
   preferred next splitter, the target-cell rule (nauty's `bestcell`
   under the pinned `tc_level = 100`), and the row order used when
   comparing relabelled adjacency matrices.
6. Pruning, briefly. The prunings the production search performs
   (first-path and best-path code comparison, discovered
   automorphisms, orbit pruning, short-prune), each with one or two
   sentences on the idea, and the statement that every one preserves
   the selected form and label, so none is part of the specification.
7. Scope. The function specified is dense nauty 2.9.3 under the pinned
   option block, restated or summarized inline (a manual chapter
   cannot assume the reader has this SPEC). Sparse nauty and Traces
   compute different canonical forms, so "nauty's canonical form"
   without those qualifiers does not name a single function.

### Part two: the Lean implementation

The second part revisits part one's concepts in the same order and
attaches each to the Lean declarations, quoted through Verso so the
prose cannot drift from the code. Requirements:

- Every declaration named in prose uses the `{name}` role, and the
  load-bearing definitions are included with `{docstring}`, per
  [SPEC/writing-style.md](../../SPEC/writing-style.md). A rename or a
  docstring change then fails `lake build HexManual`.
- No hand-copied signatures or restated definition bodies. Where part
  two needs to show a definition, it quotes the declaration.
- The worked refinement example from part one is repeated as an
  evaluated Lean example (`#eval` with checked output), so the hand
  trace in part one is machine-checked against the implementation.

The anchor declarations, by part-one concept (all in the
`Hex.GraphIso.Nauty` namespace unless stated otherwise):

| concept | declarations |
| --- | --- |
| refinement-code accumulator | `mash` |
| equitable refinement | `refine`, `refineStep` |
| target cell | `targetcell`, `bestcell` |
| leaf key and order | `Key`, `keyCmp`, `codeSentinel` |
| declarative canonical form | `canonSpecKey`, `specCanon` |
| production leaf comparison | `testcanlab`, `updatecan` |
| production entry point | `canonicalize?`, public `canonicalize` |
| canonical-form theorems | `specCanon_iso`, `specCanon_invariant`, `iso_iff_specCanon_eq` |
| checked results equal the spec | `checkCanon_form` |

If a listed declaration is renamed or refactored, the chapter follows
the code. The table above records the anchors at the time of writing,
and the `{name}` roles are what keep the chapter honest.

### Exclusions

- No pruning internals beyond item 6 of part one. The preservation
  theorems are cited, and the implementation is the reference.
- No certificate or replay material beyond a cross-reference to the
  `HexGraphIso` chapter, whose subject it is.
- No claim, anywhere, that agreement with nauty is a theorem.
- No process narrative, per
  [SPEC/writing-style.md](../../SPEC/writing-style.md) and the project style
  rules. The chapter describes the algorithm as it stands.

## nauty compatibility target

The first compatibility target is nauty 2.9.3, the stable release current when
this SPEC was written:

- source: <https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/nauty/nauty2_9_3.tar.gz>;
- SHA-256:
  `9fc4edae04f88a0f5883985be3b39cf7f898fd6cc96e96b9ee25452743cc1b5b`;
- manual: <https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/nauty/nug29.pdf>.

The development monorepo vendors the dense-nauty subset of this archive at
`vendor/nauty-2.9.3` (unmodified files; per-file hashes in that directory's
README), so conformance and benchmarking build against the pinned source
without a network fetch.

The tarball's `nauty.c`, `nautil.c`, `naugraph.c`, and `nauty.h` are normative
for implementation details. The manual and McKay and Piperno's
[Practical graph isomorphism, II](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1493) explain the
algorithm, but they do not specify all code-level choices needed for exact
output compatibility.

The oracle uses 64-bit dense `densenauty`, `m = SETWORDSNEEDED(n)`, and
`DEFAULTOPTIONS_GRAPH`. It changes only the fields required for canonical
labelling and a caller-supplied partition:

| field | value |
| --- | --- |
| `getcanon` | `1` |
| `digraph` | `FALSE` |
| `defaultptn` | `FALSE` |
| `writeautoms`, `writemarkers` | `FALSE` |
| `tc_level` | `100` |
| `userrefproc`, all user callbacks | `NULL` |
| `invarproc` | `NULL` |
| `mininvarlevel`, `maxinvarlevel`, `invararg` | `0`, `1`, `0` |
| `dispatch` | `dispatch_graph` |
| `schreier` | `FALSE` |

`getcanon = 1` is used because it is the documented canonical-labelling mode.
The 2.9.3 header still marks `LABELONLY = 2` as unimplemented, so the oracle
does not claim that mode avoids group work.

For every input, `lab` is initialized by increasing colour and then increasing
original vertex. `ptn` ends exactly at the last position of each colour cell.
Passing no active set to `densenauty` makes it activate every initial cell.
The oracle serializes the upper-triangle bits in row-major order and the
integer `lab` array. It never compares raw C setwords.

The compatibility target is frozen per SPEC revision. Advancing to a later
stable nauty release requires a deliberate SPEC amendment, review of the new
source, and full conformance. If the observable form or label changes, that is
a breaking public change. The project keeps no compatibility branches for old
nauty versions.

## Conformance

The oracle follows [the project oracle protocol](../../SPEC/testing.md#adding-a-new-oracle).
A Python JSONL driver rebuilds each original graph and partition and calls a
small project-owned C program compiled against the vendored nauty source in
`vendor/nauty-2.9.3`: unmodified files from the pinned archive,
version-controlled in the development monorepo with per-file SHA-256 hashes
recorded in that directory's README, alongside the upstream `COPYRIGHT` and
`LICENSE-2.0.txt` (Apache 2.0) files. The compiled program is cached keyed by
the SHA-256 of its source together with every vendored file it links. A
compile failure, nauty error, or output mismatch fails the run. The vendored
source and both nauty comparators are development tooling only: they are not
managed paths of any released repository, and the production library never
links nauty.

Each record contains the original graph, colour vector, Hex canonical form,
Hex label, search counters, and schema version. The oracle independently
computes and compares:

- ordered colour-cell sizes;
- the canonical upper-triangle adjacency bits;
- every entry of `canonlab`.

The driver must not canonicalize Hex's answer before comparing it with nauty.
Doing so would test only isomorphism of the outputs and could conceal a wrong
canonical representative.

The committed merge-CI fixture is at most 16 MiB and contains:

- all 1,100 labelled uncoloured graphs for `0 ≤ n ≤ 5`;
- all 4,912 graph and ordered-surjective-partition pairs for `0 ≤ n ≤ 4`;
- deterministic relabellings and colourings of named larger examples;
- positive and negative isomorphism pairs;
- graphs whose automorphism groups are trivial, small, and large.

The counts include labelled graphs. The 1,044 commonly listed graphs on seven
vertices are unlabelled isomorphism classes and are not this fixture count.

The scheduled and local campaign adds all 32,768 labelled graphs at `n = 6`,
larger deterministic random cases, and the hard families below. These cases
stream directly to the oracle. Only failures are retained as replay records.
`conformance/HexGraphIso/EmitCampaign.lean` is the emitter, and
[reports/hex-graph-iso-campaign.md](../../reports/hex-graph-iso-campaign.md)
records the current run: machine, date, toolchain, comparator version, case
count, what was compared, runtime, and outcome. A campaign re-run replaces
that report in place. Conformance runs in the existing single Ubuntu job. It
does not add a job, matrix, or workflow.

Property checks independent of nauty include:

- `relabel G (label G) = canon G`;
- invariance under deterministic random relabelling;
- colour preservation and contiguity;
- agreement with `Reference.canon` on the isomorphism verdict;
- agreement among all retained implementation stages on their common domain;
- rejection of a changed edge, colour, permutation entry, refinement record,
  automorphism, prune record, leaf comparison, or difference position in a
  certificate;
- `none`, never `false`, after search or replay exhaustion.

## Reproducible generators

There is no single maintained nauty benchmark collection. The published
nauty and Traces experiments use families from the bliss benchmark
distribution. This project reproduces the mathematical constructions instead
of vendoring an archive with unclear redistribution terms. The family choices
are informed by the
[Traces performance pages](https://pallini.di.uniroma1.it/StronglyRegular.html)
and the graph classes generated by nauty's `genspecialg`.

All pseudo-random generation uses SplitMix64 with wrapping `UInt64`
arithmetic:

```text
state := state + 0x9E3779B97F4A7C15
z := state
z := (z xor (z >> 30)) * 0xBF58476D1CE4E5B9
z := (z xor (z >> 27)) * 0x94D049BB133111EB
output := z xor (z >> 31)
```

The corpus seeds start with `0x243F6A8885A308D3` and
`0x13198A2E03707344`. `nextBelow` uses rejection sampling rather than `%`, so
the generator is independent of modulo bias and implementation language.

- `G(n, 1/2)` consumes one low bit for each pair `(i,j)` with `i < j` in
  lexicographic order.
- Random relabelling uses Fisher-Yates from the last array position down.
- An onto `k`-colouring starts with `i mod k` and shuffles that vector.
- A random cubic graph shuffles three copies of every vertex, pairs adjacent
  entries, and rejects a trial containing a loop or duplicate edge. The next
  trial continues the same SplitMix64 stream. Only named seeds which terminate
  under the recorded trial cap enter the corpus.

The deterministic families are:

- empty, complete, path, cycle, complete bipartite, complete multipartite,
  circulant, and repeated-component graphs;
- grids, hypercubes, Johnson, Kneser, triangular, lattice, and Paley graphs;
- incidence graphs of cyclic Latin squares, Sylvester Hadamard matrices, and
  projective planes over small prime fields;
- CFI/Fürer pairs over `K4`, the triangular prism, and the cube;
- Miyazaki and multipede instances from their published constructions;
- ordered-colour variants which expose or break natural symmetries.

Each generator has a mathematical definition, parameter validation, and a
stable vertex-numbering rule in its module docstring. The initial parameter
manifest includes:

| family | parameters |
| --- | --- |
| basic and random | `n = 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128` |
| grid | side `4, 6, 8, 12, 16` |
| hypercube | dimension `3` through `8` |
| Johnson and Kneser | ambient size `5` through `16`, supported `k` |
| Paley | `q = 13, 17, 29, 37, 53` |
| Latin | order `4` through `10` |
| Hadamard | order `8, 16, 32, 64` |
| projective plane | `q = 2, 3, 5, 7` |
| CFI | `K4`, triangular prism, cube |

Large rungs stop at the existing benchmark wallclock limit. The manifest is
still recorded even when a retained implementation cannot complete its upper
rungs.

## Benchmarks

The Mathlib-free benchmark driver registers:

- `Reference.canon` on factorially feasible sizes;
- the unpruned implementation and every retained pruning stage on common
  inputs;
- public `canonicalize`, `findIso`, and `isIso`;
- dense conversion, one complete refinement, relabelling, canonical graph
  comparison, certificate generation, and certificate replay;
- the pinned nauty comparator through a benchmark-only in-process FFI
  binding (`Hex.BenchOracle.Nauty` over
  `Hex/BenchOracle/ffi/nauty_canon.c`), statically linked against the
  vendored nauty 2.9.3 source in `vendor/nauty-2.9.3` — the FFI
  pattern of
  [benchmarking.md](../../SPEC/benchmarking.md#external-comparators). The
  vendored source and the comparator are development-monorepo tooling
  only and ship with no released library.

Every canonicalization result is hashed from its ordered cell sizes,
upper-triangle adjacency bits, and label. `compare` therefore checks exact
result agreement as well as timing. The nauty comparator is `gating` in the
terminology of [benchmarking.md](../../SPEC/benchmarking.md#external-comparators), but
the first release sets no speed-ratio requirement. Its required result is
exact output agreement.

The registrations report wallclock, allocation, result hash, visited nodes,
refinement calls, canonical updates, automorphisms checked, branches pruned,
certificate records and bytes, and checker steps. `relabel` and graph
comparison declare quadratic bit-matrix models. A full dense refinement
declares a conservative cubic model. Canonical search declares no polynomial
model in `n`. Reports use node count and per-node work to explain its cost.
Certificate replay is modelled against certificate records plus the charged
vertex, permutation-entry, and adjacency-word visits.

Merge CI runs a small deterministic subset and keeps the complete `Bench
verify` invocation inside its existing time limit. Hard families and full
nauty timing comparisons run in the existing scheduled performance workflow
on dedicated hardware.

The published cactus figures must stay current with the code. The
per-instance sweep data lives under `reports/bench-results/` keyed by
a content fingerprint of the source it measured, alongside the
manifest that fingerprint hashes; the figures under `reports/figures/`
are rendered from it, and any change to hex-graph-iso implementation
source must regenerate both in the same pull request
(`scripts/bench/graphiso_cactus_sweep.sh` does the whole
regeneration). `scripts/bench/check_graphiso_sweep_freshness.py` is
the required check: it fails whenever the implementation, the graph
substrate, the sweep driver, or the plot script differs from what any
committed sweep measured. The relevant set is deliberately tight and
regeneration takes minutes, so this family declares no exemption
directory at all: re-measuring is the only way past the check, with the
one exception that the check establishes for itself rather than taking
on trust, a `.lean` path whose two versions are equal once their
comments are removed. Editing a docstring under `HexGraphIso/` therefore
costs no sweep, while any change to code or to indentation does. The
fingerprinting mechanism is shared with the other published figure
families; see [SPEC/benchmarking.md](../../SPEC/benchmarking.md)
§Figure freshness.

The recorded sweep also fixes the per-node asymptotics. Because the
search visits nauty's tree node for node, the hex/nauty wallclock ratio
is a per-node constant factor, and the only way the implementation can
fall behind nauty asymptotically is for that factor to grow with `n`:
an elementwise loop over vertices where nauty runs a word operation
shows up as a larger exponent in a power-law fit of per-node cost
against `n`. `scripts/bench/graphiso_pernode_fit.py --check 0.2` is the
required check that prevents this: it fits `cost per node ~ n^e` per
family for hex and for nauty from the most recent recorded sweep and
fails when, on any family with at least five sizes, the hex exponent
exceeds nauty's by more than `0.2`. It is a growth check, not a
constant-factor check: a slowdown uniform in `n` is the per-library
bench's business. The vertex sets of the search are packed sixty-three
vertices to a word (`Nauty.VSet`), so every set operation is a loop
over `⌈n/63⌉` limbs, the same shape as nauty's `setword` loops.

Recorded sweeps accumulate: each regeneration adds its data,
tactic-timing snapshot, and a `.meta.json` (fingerprint, host, date,
label) under `reports/bench-results/` without removing predecessors.
A change to the instance corpus itself is a series break: it lands as
its own pull request whose frame label says so, and curve comparisons
(the before/after tables, the animation's fixed axes) are only
meaningful between sweeps on the same corpus. The first such break
adds the irregular negative pairs, whose absence had made every
corpus negative regular and the separator tiers invisible.
The second break extends every deterministic family to large hard
instances up to the nauty comparator's `n ≤ 255` bound (Paley to 229,
Kneser/Johnson to `m = 22`, hypercube to `q7`, circulants and the
random ladder to 255, grids to 15×15), adds the Latin-square family
with the classic strongly regular negative `paley25` versus `latin5`
at shared parameters `(25, 12, 5, 6)`, and adds same-degree regular
and vertex-transitive negatives at scale; large negatives whose
kernel replay exceeds the tactic timeout count as unsolved in the
tactic curve, which is the honest frontier of that tier. nauty
cross-checks for the new sizes run in the streamed campaign, not the
committed fixture set, keeping merge-CI oracle time unchanged.
Every pull request that improves the measured performance of any
layer (canonical labelling or tactic) posts a before/after comparison as a
pull-request comment: `scripts/plots/hexgraphiso-before-after.py`
renders the overlay figure and prints the per-layer markdown delta
table from two recorded sweeps, the figure is committed under
`reports/figures/` and embedded in the comment by its raw URL at the
pull request's head commit.
`scripts/plots/hexgraphiso-cactus-animation.py` assembles the
accumulated sweeps, in recorded-date order with fixed axes, into
`reports/figures/hexgraphiso-cactus-animation.gif`.

The tactic has fresh-module probes for reification, compiled search, literal
elaboration, kernel replay, and the complete tactic. Before release, the
following cases must close within their logical limits:

- a positive random `n = 12` pair related by a recorded relabelling;
- a negative pair from the two recorded `G(12, 1/2)` seeds;
- positive and negative ordered-colour pairs at `n = 10`;
- a scheduled negative CFI pair under separately recorded larger limits.

Measured wallclock requirements are added only after these probes exist and
must satisfy the repository's matched fresh-build protocol. Compile-time toy
examples alone do not complete the tactic milestone.

## Release conditions

The first release requires all of the following:

1. No `sorry`, axiom, or `native_decide` occurs in the library or tactic
   correctness path.
2. The reference and production biconditional theorems are complete.
3. `canon?_eq_some` and `checkCanon_sound` have the conclusions stated above.
4. Every implemented prune has an answer-and-label preservation proof.
5. The exhaustive merge fixture and extended `n = 6` campaign agree exactly
   with nauty 2.9.3. The fixture leg runs in merge CI; the campaign leg is
   recorded in
   [reports/hex-graph-iso-campaign.md](../../reports/hex-graph-iso-campaign.md).
6. The non-toy positive and negative tactic cases replay through the kernel.
7. The benchmark driver reports every implementation stage and the nauty
   comparator without importing Mathlib.

Complete automorphism generators are not a release condition. If later work
adds them, checking that each permutation is an automorphism is only
soundness. A completeness theorem must show that the reported generators
generate every automorphism, using the same canonical search tree or an
equivalent complete argument.
